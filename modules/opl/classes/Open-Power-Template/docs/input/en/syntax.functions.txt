Title: Function reference

----

In this chapter, the available functions are described. 

In OPT, all the functions that operate on the specified value, take it always as the first parameter, even if their equivalent in PHP requires it as the last one!

Function data
=============

Unlike PHP, many functions may operate both on a single value and a container of values. In the second case, the function is applied to all of the container elements:

~~~~
[xml]

<p>A formatted, single value: {money($profits.corporation)}</p>

<p>The function used on the container:</p>

{@formattedProfits are money($profits)}

<p>Corporation customer profits: {@formattedProfits.corporation}</p>
<p>Individual customer profits: {@formattedProfits.individual}</p>
<p>Training profits: {@formattedProfits.training}</p>

~~~~

The function result is returned and must be saved to another variable in order to be used or passed to another function.

OPT and Unicode
===============

The available functions are not designed for any particular character encoding due to the planned support for Unicode in PHP6. If you want to use UTF-8 with PHP 5.x, you have to be patient or write your own versions of the functions. We will try to release an optional set of UTF-ready functions as a plugin before releasing the first stable OPT version.
