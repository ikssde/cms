A CDATA section is a special part of the XML document that is visible by the parser, but it is not processed. It allows to keep XML tags as a static text that will not be parsed. By default, OPT parses the CDATA section , like in XML - the content is displayed with the surrounding delimiters, but not parsed. However, sometimes we do not want that:

~~~~
[xml]
<script type="text/javascript">
<![CDATA[
    document.write('Text ]]>{$info}<![CDATA[ - here is some info from the script.');
]]>
</script>
~~~~

Of course, OPT will destroy such code, because the JavaScript will be full of opening and closing CDATA tags. The problem can be solved with the `opt:literal` instruction. Now, the CDATA sections are still not parsed, but at least their tags are not rewritten to the output:

~~~~
[xml]
<script type="text/javascript">
<opt:literal><![CDATA[
    document.write('Text ]]>{$info}<![CDATA[ - here is some info from the script.');
]]></opt:literal>
</script>
~~~~

By default, `opt:literal` produces CDATA tags around its content, so the final result is:

~~~~
[xml]
<script type="text/javascript">
<![CDATA[
    document.write('Text SOME SCRIPT INFO - here is some info from the script.');
]]>
</script>
~~~~

`opt:literal` can also produce dynamic comment content or be transparent.

> [warning]
> JavaScript and CSS content enclosed with CDATA section can cause problems with some older browsers so your code may not work properly. It is recommended to use `mode="comment_cdata"` attribute on `opt:literal` instruction to solve this problem. More details can be found in [chapter about opt:literal][syntax.instructions.literal] and on [Mozilla Developer Center][proper_cdata] website.
