Title: compile()
ShortTitle: Opt_Compiler_Class::compile()
Reference: void compile(string $code, string $filename, string $compiledFilename, int $mode)

---

Compiles the specified template code `$code` taken from `$filename` file and saves it under `$compiledFilename` on the hard disk. The `$mode` parameter tells, which compiler mode to use:

1. XML
2. Quirks

They are identified by suitable constants in `Opt_Class`. 

The method compiles also the whole template inheritance chain, if necessary. The compiled inherited templates are included in the main template code and are not saved separately.

> [warning]
> The method cannot be called recursively within the same compiler object. OPT throws an exception then.
