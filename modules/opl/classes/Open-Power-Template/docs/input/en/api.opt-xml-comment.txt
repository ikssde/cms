Title: Opt_Xml_Comment class
ShortTitle: Opt_Xml_Comment
Construct: class
Extends: api.opt-xml-cdata

----

The class represents the XML comments and provides an API to manipulate their contents. The class extends `Opt_Xml_Cdata`, so we can use the same manipulation methods, as in case of ordinary character data nodes.

Note that every XML node may become a comment by setting the node flag `commented` to true. Their contents, including the node itself, will be enclosed within `<!--` and `-->` tags:

~~~~
[php]
$node->set('commented', true);
~~~~
