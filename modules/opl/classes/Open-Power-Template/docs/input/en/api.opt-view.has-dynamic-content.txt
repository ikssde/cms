----

This method is used in the caching systems to support the [opt:dynamic][syntax.instructions.dynamic] tag in the cached views. It returns **true**, if the instruction has been used and there is some content that must remain dynamic even in the cache file. The method should be used in conjunction with [getOutputBuffers()][api.opt-view.get-output-buffers].
