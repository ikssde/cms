Title: processSystemVar()
ShortTitle: Opt_Compiler_Processor::processSystemVar()
Reference: void processSystemVar(Array $sys)
Status: extendable public

---

Parses the OPT special container `$sys.processorName`. You should extend it to provide your own implementation for this variable. The method takes the array of the indexes that create the variable call. For example, the `$sys.foo.bar` is processed by the *foo* processor and `processSystemVar()` receives an array of three values:

~~~~
0 => sys
1 => foo
2 => bar
~~~~

The expected returned value is the PHP code generated from the container.

> [warning]
> `$opt` is an alias to `$sys` in the templates. In this case, the first element of the array is *opt* instead of *sys*.
