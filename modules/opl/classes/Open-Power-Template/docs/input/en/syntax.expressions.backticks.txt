Title: Backticks

----

OPT supports a special type of strings written in the backticks: `` ` ``. Their behavior can be programmed by the programmer. In the example above, the backticks are used as a template access to the Access Control List system:

~~~~
[xml]
<opt:if test="`/user/control/security`">
    <p>User IP: {$user.ip}</p>
</opt:if>
~~~~

Currently, OPT does not support a concatenation of the backtick strings, but this feature is planned to appear in the future releases.

For programmers
===============

Backtick string handler is an ordinary function or object method that takes one argument - the backtick string content. It may be registered in the template using a configuration directive `backticks`:

~~~~
[php]
function myBacktickHandler($string)
{
	return strtoupper($string);
} // end myBacktickHandler();

$tpl->backticks = 'myBacktickHandler';
~~~~

> [error]
> Note that using the backticks without a handler registered causes an exception.
