Title: render()
ShortTitle: Opt_Output_Http::render()
Construct: method
Reference: mixed render(Opt_View $view)
Visibility: public
Arguments:
 - Name: $view | Type: api.opt-view | Desc: The view to render

----

Renders the `$view` and sends the results as a HTTP response. If OPT works in XML mode, this method may be executed only once for maximum one view. This prevents from building an invalid XML document from valid XML templates by concatenating them in the unsupported way.

> Creating modular templates that can be used in XML mode is described in a chapter about [modularization][syntax.topics.modularization].
