Title: truncate()
Reference: string truncate(string $text, integer $length [, string $ending [, boolean $breakWords ]])

----

Truncates the text `$text` to the specified `$length`. Optionally, you might define the `$ending` that is added to the `$text`, if it has been truncated. The last argument allows to control if the function might break words (**true**, default value) or not (**false**). Below you can see a sample results for the text `This is a very long text that needs to be truncated`:

~~~~
[xml]
{@text is 'This is a very long text that needs to be truncated'}

<!-- result: "This is a very lo" -->
{truncate(@text, 17)}

<!-- result: "This is a very lo..." -->
{truncate(@text, 17, '...')}

<!-- result: "This is a very long text that needs to be truncated" -->
{truncate(@text, 500, '...')}

<!-- result: "This is a very..." -->
{truncate(@text, 17, '...', false)}
