Title: Opt_Xml_Dtd class
ShortTitle: Opt_Xml_Dtd
Construct: class

----

The class represents the Document Type Definition. It is not a part of the XML tree itself, but can be assigned to the `Opt_Xml_Root` objects using the `setDtd()` method. Open Power Template does not provide a parser for the DTD itself, so the definition is stored as a plain text. However, the behavior may be extended in the future.
