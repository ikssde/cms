Title: Instruction plugins
SeeAlso:
 - extending.plugins

----

Instructions can be packed as plugins, however, they need a more sophisticated format. Open Power Template requires the instruction plugins to:

* The file name must be in the format: `instruction.Foo.php`
* The class name must be in the format: `Opt_Instruction_Foo`, where `Foo` must be the same, as in the file name.

A sample instruction plugin can be found below:

~~~~
[php]
<?php
// instruction.Plugin.php

class Opt_Instruction_Plugin extends Opt_Compiler_Processor
{
	// ...
} // end Opt_Instruction_Plugin;
~~~~

Note that you can also register the instruction manually:

~~~~
[php]
$tpl->register(Opt_Class::OPT_INSTRUCTION, 'Foo');	// Registers "Opt_Instruction_Foo"
$tpl->register(Opt_Class::OPT_INSTRUCTION, 'Foo', 'Some_Class'); // Registers "Foo" in the "Some_Class" class
~~~~

In this case, the class name does not have to begin with `Opt_Instruction`. The second line shows, how to register such classes in OPT.
