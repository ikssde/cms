VersionSince: 2.0.1
Visibility: public
Returns: The static parts of the template.

----

This method is used in the caching systems to support the [opt:dynamic][syntax.instructions.dynamic] tag in the cached views. It returns the list of cached parts of the executed template, except the last one which must be closed manually.

The dynamic part of the cached template is saved by the compiler in the file with the `.dyn` extension in the compilation directory. It is a serialized array of PHP code snippets which should be mingled with the static data returned by this method. Below, you can see a sample mingling algorithm:

~~~~
[php]
if($view->hasDynamicContent())
{
	$list = $view->getOutputBuffers();
	$dynamic = unserialize(file_get_contents($tpl->compileDir.$view->_convert($view->getTemplate()).'.dyn'));

	$output = '';

	for($i = 0; $i < sizeof($list); $i++)
	{
		$output .= $list[$i].'<'.'?php '.$dynamic[$i].' ?>';
	}
	$output .= ob_get_flush();
}
~~~~

> [error]
> In order to get the content of the last buffer, you must use `ob_get_flush()`, as the returned code must also appear in the browser.
