Title: opt:dynamic
SeeAlso:
 - syntax.attributes.dynamic
 - extending.caching-systems

----

The content of this tag must remain dynamic even if the template output is cached. The compiler captures the PHP code generated by the content and allows to include it in the cached file. Note that OPT does not provide any caching system and this feature must be implemented in the external cache engine in order to be supported.

If there is no caching system set in the view, the instruction has no effect on the template.
