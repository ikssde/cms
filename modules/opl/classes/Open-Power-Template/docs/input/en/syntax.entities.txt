Title: Entities

Because OPT contains an XML parser, the entities used in the templates are parsed on the server-side. Only the five special XML characters are converted back to the entities before sending the document to the server: `amp`, `quot`, `lt`, `gt`, `apos`. This is usually a good thing. Especially, if you are using UTF-8, you do not have to worry about how the entities are handled, because the browser accepts both the entity strings and the direct character codes.

OPT supports the Unicode entities like `&#184;` and `&#0xB8`. The special HTML entities like `&nbsp;` or `&Acute;` are parsed only if the configuration option `htmlEntities` is set to **true**. If the parser encounters an unknown entity, it generates an exception. You can register your own entities in the parser. The default entities added by OPT are `&lb;` for `{` and `&rb;` for `}`.

If you need to display an entity in the output document, you may use the function `entity()`.
