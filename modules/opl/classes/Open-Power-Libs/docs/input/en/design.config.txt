Title: Configuration options

----

The OPL core can be configured by setting the `Opl_Registry` states. These options apply to all OPL libraries:

~~~~
[php]
Opl_Registry::setState('some_option', 'value');
~~~~

Below, you can find a list of possible options:

opl_debug_console
:	Turns on/off the debug console globally

opl_extended_errors
:	Shows the extended error information in the exception handler. You should disable this option in your production environment.

opl_custom_console
:	Hides the default debug console generated by OPL, allowing to install a custom one. The original console still collects the data, and the programmer may load them from the console memory.
