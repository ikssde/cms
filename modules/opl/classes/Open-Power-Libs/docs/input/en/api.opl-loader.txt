This class provides the necessary autoload utilities for the OPL core. The autoloader supports the following features:

1. Automatic loading based on the class/interface name.
2. Core files with more than one class and interface that are always used by the library and therefore must be always available.
3. Manual mapping. You can provide the path to the file with the class manually.
