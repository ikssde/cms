Title: Standard installation

----

Create a single directory for the OPL libraries code called "installation directory". Each OPL package contains an `/lib` folder whose must be copied to the installation directory.

In order to use OPL libraries in your project, you need to load the core file and register an autoloader:

~~~~
[php]
require('../../lib/Opl/Base.php');
Opl_Loader::setDirectory('../../lib/');
Opl_Loader::register();

// use the libraries now
~~~~

OPL uses exceptions to report problems and errors. It is recommended to capture them. The basic exception class used by the libraries is `Opl_Exception`, but each of the libraries provides also its own class. OPL contains also the default exception handler:

~~~~
[php]
require('../../lib/Opl/Base.php');
Opl_Loader::setDirectory('../../lib/');
Opl_Loader::register();

try
{
    // your code
}
catch(Opl_Exception $exception)
{
    Opl_Error_Handler($exception);
}
