Support rules
=============

* We do not offer e-mail support (especially via our private mailboxes). You will be redirected to the discussion board.
* The discussion board is not a place to report **bugs**. Of course, it is possible that something that looks like a problem is in fact a bug, but obvious issues must be reported in the bugtracker immediately.
* The default discussion board language is English, however they might appear some national boards.
* Before starting a new topic, use the search tool and check the documentation. Although it is not finished yet, in come cases it is useful.
* To get a precise and fast answer, you must provide a detailed description of your problem. Add some code snippets, information on the used software versions (OPL, PHP, framework) and describe what does not work.
* Please read the discussion board rules before posting.
